 * libGLdispatch manages the dispatch table used to dispatch OpenGL and GLES
 * functions to the appropriate vendor library for the current context.
 *
 * Window system libraries (libGLX.so and eventually libEGL.so) use
 * libGLdispatch.so to set and keep track of the current rendering context.
 * Their respective MakeCurrent calls (glXMakeCurrent and eglMakeCurrent) pass
 * in a dispatch table for whatever vendor owns the current context.
 *
 * The entrypoint libraries (libOpenGL.so, libGL.so, libGLESv1_CM.so, and
 * libGLESv2.so) all use the dispatch table stored in libGLdispatch.so.
 *
