/*
 * Allocate 64 bytes for each stub so that they're large enough to hold the
 * x86-64 TSD stubs. The x86 TSD and x86-64 TLS stubs both take 32 bytes each.
 *
 * The x86-64 TSD stubs are larger than the others because it has to deal with
 * 64-bit addresses and preserving the function arguments.
 *
 * The generated stubs may not be within 2GB of u_current or
 * u_current_get_internal, so we can't use RIP-relative addressing for them.
 * Instead we have to use movabs instructions to load the 64-bit absolute
 * addresses, which take 10 bytes each.
 *
 * In addition, x86-64 passes the first 6 parameters in registers, which the
 * callee does not have to preserve. Since the stub has to pass those same
 * parameters to the real function, we have to preserve them across the call to
 * u_current_get_internal. Pushing and popping those registers takes another 24
 * bytes.
