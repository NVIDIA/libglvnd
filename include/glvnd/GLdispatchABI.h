 * A callback function called by the vendor library to fetch the address of an
 * entrypoint.
 *
 * The function returns two pointers, one writable and one executable. The two
 * pointers may or may not be the same virtual address, but they will both be
 * mappings of the same physical memory.
 *
 * The vendor library should write its entrypoint to the address returned by
 * \p writePtr, but should use the address from \p execPtr for things like
 * calculating PC-relative offsets.
 *
 * Note that if this function fails, then the vendor library can still try to
 * patch other entrypoints.
 *
 * Note that on ARM, the low-order bit of both \c execPtr and \p writePtr will
 * be zero, even if the stub uses the thumb instruction set. The vendor library
 * should use the \c type parameter of \c initiatePatch to determine which
 * instruction set to use.
 *
 * \param funcName The function name.
 * \param[out] writePtr The pointer that the vendor library can write to.
 * \param[out] execPtr The pointer to the executable code.
 * \return GL_TRUE if the entrypoint exists, or GL_FALSE if it doesn't.
