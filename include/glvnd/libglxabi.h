 * \defgroup glxvendorabi GLX Vendor ABI
 *
 * Definition of ABI exported by libGLX.so to libGLX_VENDOR.so libraries.
 *
 * Each vendor is associated with three distinct dispatch table types:
 *
 * - static GLX dispatch table: this is the fixed list of GLX 1.4 entrypoints
 *   provided by the vendor at load time during the initial handshake.
 * - dynamic GLX dispatch table: this is a structure allocated by the API
 *   library at runtime used to manage GLX extension functions which are not
 *   present in the static table.
 * - core GL dispatch table: this is a structure maintained by the API library
 *   which contains both GL core (static) and GL extension (dynamic) functions.
 *
 * Note that while the implementations of most GLX functions in a vendor
 * library is mostly unchanged from a traditional, single-vendor driver, libGLX
 * has additional requirements for GLXContext and GLXFBConfig handle values.
 *
 * First, all GLXContext and GLXFBConfig handles have to be unique between
 * vendor libraries. That is, every GLXContext or GLXFBConfig handle must map
 * to exactly one vendor library, so that libGLX knows which library to dispatch
 * to.
 *
 * To do that, all GLXContext and GLXFBConfig handles *must* be a pointer to an
 * address that the vendor library somehow controls. The address doesn't need
 * to be readable or writable, but it must be an address that no other vendor
 * library would use.
 *
 * The address could be a pointer to a structure, or an address in a statically
 * or dynamically allocated array. It could even be a file mapping, or even an
 * offset into wherever the vendor library itself is mapped.
 *
 * A vendor library may not, however, use anything like an index or an XID for
 * a GLXContext or GLXFBConfig handle.
 *
 * GLXContext handles must also be globally unique across all display
 * connections in the entire process. That is, a vendor library may not return
 * the same GLXContext handle for two different contexts, even if they're on
 * different displays or different servers.
 *
 * GLXFBConfigs may be duplicated between multiple displays, as long as they
 * are still unique between vendors. Some applications even depend on this:
 * They will look up a GLXFBConfig handle with one connection, and then try to
 * use that config on another connection.
